GitHub Milestones

Written on the occasion of reaching the 19,999th Star on GitHub

> Stars are good, but don't get greedy.
> Two years ago, during Annual Review setting goals for the year, I thought about writing an open-source framework. Last year when setting this year's goals, I still had that idea. This year, again setting goals for next year, 2333~~.

Not long ago, while checking my Star count (Stars are not designed for "likes" but for bookmarking) on GitHub Ranking, I noticed it was almost 20,000. Then I went through my projects and realized I didn't have a good **representative framework**. They were either applications or e-books.

Among the top 8 projects, except for the Growth app, the others were all e-book content – six e-books combined have **10,619** Stars. Indeed, it's about attracting Stars. I could only try my best to think: how did things come to this?

### Starting with Creating an Open-Source Framework

Creating an open-source framework is different from creating an open-source project. The former serves developers, the latter serves users.

Two years ago, during Annual Review, I thought about creating an open-source framework in the coming year. I had just graduated and wasn't very familiar with the rules of the open-source world: **Open source isn't about uploading code and suddenly becoming popular**. Although we can gain some attention in the short term, not many people actually adopt it in their projects.

At that time, my main problem was: **People wanting to participate in the project didn't have sufficient skills**. You still need to spend a lot of time teaching them. Encouraging GitHub beginners isn't easy. Sometimes I need to accept their PR and then modify their code. And people submit PRs for various reasons.

Then, I learned another rule in the open-source world: **Whoever has greater influence can have a wider impact**. For example, Virtual DOM wasn't pioneered by Facebook, but it became popular because of FB. When Yukihiro Matsumoto wrote the README for mruby (from what I recall), the Star count had already exceeded 1k. There are countless examples like this, either because effort was put into promotion, or because individuals/companies had greater influence.

A year ago, I slightly changed my strategy: temporarily focusing on **training people**, while still thinking about creating a suitable open-source framework – though this year, it seems there's no suitable place in the front-end field to reinvent the wheel.

A common problem on GitHub is that **the maintainer of most projects is the initiator** – if something happens to the initiator, what happens to the project? If it's a very popular project, it carries huge risk; this might also indicate a lack of a proper mechanism.

Your open-source project not only needs a usage document but also a document on related design ideas, roadmap, future plans, etc.

At the end of last year, when writing a summary, I thought about using the RePractise article as a basis to train people, which led to the three Growth projects:

 - App: [Growth](https://github.com/phodal/growth)
 - E-book: "[Growth: Full-Stack Growth Engineer Guide](https://github.com/phodal/growth-ebook)"
 - E-book: "[Growth: Full-Stack Growth Engineer in Action](https://github.com/phodal/growth-in-action)"

Now Growth has over ten thousand users, with nearly 300 active users daily. The first step seems successful, but what's the next step?

### The Next Open-Source Project

Later, I started pondering a question: is creating an open-source framework necessary?

While writing the Growth e-book, I found that good software engineering practices are far more important than an easy-to-use framework. Frameworks themselves are volatile. In the past, you used Backbone; now you use React.js. In the past, you used Angular.js; now you use Vue. Knowing how to use a specific framework isn't the standard distinguishing an experienced developer.

Focusing constantly on **learning to use different frameworks** is problematic. A student can easily understand the principles of a framework better than you – you work during the day, while they study all day. Then you easily lose competitiveness. You need to understand deeper things beyond frameworks. **A good framework doesn't guarantee you'll write good code**.

This is my self-defense for the Markdown on GitHub – who says I always have the urge to write?

However, I still have some ideas; I just haven't found enough time to think about them.

**GNU/Linux Desktop**. This was an idea a few years ago. At that time, GNU/Linux operating systems didn't have a fun desktop. But it felt like a deep rabbit hole, so I didn't proceed.

**Home Smart Hub**. I still have a bit of nostalgia for the knowledge I learned in university. Although I've written a book, hardware is still quite exciting. The only problem is: without a house, how do you do smart home?

**Graphics Framework**. This came up when I was making a graphical interface and found no suitable framework meeting my requirements. Then I thought, maybe I should make one myself.

However, the best open-source project is the one you use daily. So, I started writing various tools for my own use – like the WeChat editor tool I'm using now: [mdpub](https://github.com/phodal/mdpub).

Finally, I made a simple HTML5 animation to mark this moment, as a commemoration of this milestone:
