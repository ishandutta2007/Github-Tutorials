My GitHub homepage shows the joining date—``Joined on Nov 8, 2010``. I was just a freshman then, and for a long time after that, I never logged in. Perhaps because I wasn't studying computer science, it wasn't until today—``2015.3.9``—that I realized this is actually a social network for programmers.

In the past, for quite some time, I tried to maintain a streak on GitHub and also tried to understand how others use this tool effectively. Of course, followers are also quite important on GitHub.

Here, I will try to share everything I have learned on GitHub.

## My Story with GitHub

During my senior year job search, I tried to find hardware or IoT-related jobs (PS: my major was Electronic Information Engineering). Even though my resume was filled with various experiences, it was useless. After attending several campus recruitment fairs, I didn't submit any of the ten resumes (PS: I was mentally prepared beforehand) because my school was directly rejected. I had no interest in forced interviews; a thousand-mile horse needs a discerning eye. Later, I joined the company where [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/) works, but that's another story.

This is a harsh world. In student days, if you're not handsome or tall, most additional skills are useless (PS: the wealthy usually don't read this article). In the working world, if your previous employer isn't well-known, it will affect the treatment of your next job. However, many things can change this, and GitHub is one of them.

I registered for GitHub roughly in my freshman year, but only got familiar with it in my senior year. Now, I've been graduated for a year. Over the past two years, I've tried creating projects on GitHub along several dimensions:

1. Quickly get started with frameworks for practical use, i.e., demos.
2. Refactor others' code.
3. Create frameworks for my own use.
4. Rapidly build large applications.
5. Build general-purpose frameworks.

### GitHub and Gains

Let's talk about **gains unrelated to skills** first. My graduation project was a "[Minimal IoT System](https://github.com/phodal/iot)". Considering that the professors in our major didn't have knowledge in this area, which might cause issues during the defense, I tried to align with it as much as possible. By the time I graduated, this project had over a hundred Stars. Such easy-to-get-started things are still quite popular (PS: but hardware-related projects are usually limited by the relatively small number of hardware development engineers on GitHub).

One month after graduation, I received an email from PACKT Publishing (PS: they found me on GitHub) about reviewing an [IoT](iot) book, namely "Learning Internet of Things" mentioned in the article "[From Reviewing to Translating IT Books](http://www.phodal.com/blog/review-it-books-with-translate-book/)". As an "IoT expert" who hadn't passed CET-4, reviewing an English IoT book...

Of course, I finished the review later, and the book includes my English bio.

A month ago, I received an email from MANNING Publishing (PS: also from GitHub) about reviewing the table of contents for an [IoT](iot) book and providing suggestions.

This also brought many other things, but that's not the main topic here. We won't discuss various spam emails or Chinese cooperation here. I never imagined I could have a small space in the English-speaking world.

This tells us that if you find a topic you're good at on GitHub, many people will come to you.

### GitHub and Growth

I previously wrote an article "[How to Improve Yourself Through GitHub](http://www.phodal.com/blog/use-github-grow-self/)". Now I just want to say three things:

1. Testing
2. More testing
3. Even more, more, more testing

Projects without tests are nonsense, unless your project has only one function, and that function returns `Hello, World`.

If your project code has thousands of lines, and if you can ensure test coverage reaches 95% or above, then I think your project won't have overly complex functions. Even if there is such a function, it's covered by tests.

If you are dedicated to this project, then when you see poorly written code, you'll try to improve it, i.e., refactor. After having some experience, your skills will continuously improve. You'll start trying to touch more things, like stub, mock, fakeserver.

One day, you'll find you can't live without tests.

Then you'll believe: **Projects without tests are just playing around.**

## Why You Should Dive Deep into GitHub

Above, we talked about what we can gain. Starting to try means we know it might bring us benefits. Many examples of self-improvement have been mentioned above; let's talk about others here.

### Convenience for Work

We can acquire different knowledge, content, and information from it. Everyone can learn from others' code. When we need to build a library, we can find different libraries and code on it to implement our features. For example, when implementing a library, I would find corresponding components on GitHub:

- Promise support
- Class (PS: there wasn't a good way to use classes)
- Template: a simple template engine
- Router: to control page routing
- Ajax: basic Ajax Get/Post requests

### Landing a Job

More and more people are getting jobs because of GitHub because what they've done aligns with some companies' requirements. Then, when these companies search for code, they try to invite them.

Thus, finding suitable candidates on GitHub has become a trend.

### Expanding Social Circle

If we want to create better, more powerful frameworks, then knowing more people might bring more help. Sometimes it might have the same effect as the point above.
