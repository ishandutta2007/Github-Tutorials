# Guide to Getting Stars on GitHub

> Opening GitHub Trending every day only to see various interview guides makes life difficult. If your project is gold, then please read this article.

GitHub is a very interesting place and often becomes controversial. There is evidence that GitHub has become part of resumes to some extent. The so-called evidence is training class people helping candidates beautify their GitHub pages—from Vue-based replicas of various projects to buying Stars on Taobao to embellish the facade. As an interviewer, I have always despised such behavior. As an upright developer, they increasingly need to prove their abilities through GitHub. Otherwise, one day **bad money drives out good**, leading to increasingly poor projects on GitHub Trending.

For this purpose, I want to write a guide for those who genuinely have valuable content. Others' opinions aren't important; helping gold rise from the bottom is what we should do. If there are too many low-quality projects, opening GitHub Trending every day only to see interview guides, can that be called life? That's a life forced by interviews.

## Why We Star a Project

The key to getting Stars on GitHub is **touching people's G-spot**—people are only interested in things related to themselves. They might want to prove their interest, think the project is good to bookmark, or feel the author worked hard and want to encourage them.

Of course, I despise those who take shortcuts—placing a large number of e-books, academic materials, or courses not created by themselves on GitHub to get Stars.

The core of getting Stars is: **You have what people want, you share content people desire.** This content can be code, documentation, articles, materials, guides. As long as it helps others, it is valuable. Of course, as for GitHub itself, content controllable through Git and version management is more suitable for the platform.

So, when you have what people want, you can use this guide to help build a more successful project.

## My Way of Getting Stars

As a "big V" on GitHub, I often don't need to spend much effort on project promotion. Create a project on GitHub, and Stars come... Sometimes it's a bit "shameless"; wait until a project is stable, then give myself a Star to attract more onlookers. Then write a series of articles introducing my project. Sigh, making an open-source project isn't easy.

But these don't always work because sometimes the code I write is something everyone is completely uninterested in. For example, the Serverless password manager MoPass I recently wrote: I promoted this project on WeChat public account, blog, Zhihu, but in the end, only attracted a small group of people's attention—<= 25. After all, what you think is good is only useful to you. For others, this password manager might be far inferior to 1Password.

Another successful example: I was recently thinking about a **New Project Checklist**, i.e., when we start or join a project, what do we need to do, and what factors should we consider. So I created a project named New Project Checklist ([https://github.com/phodal/new-project-checklist](https://github.com/phodal/new-project-checklist)) on GitHub. I just wrote down the Chinese and English factors to consider in the README according to my thoughts. Before even writing the web part, it already got 100+ Stars. At the same time, since the web part wasn't done, I haven't promoted it on my blog or columns yet.

I just wrote a README, and Stars came. But generally, what do we need to do?

## GitHub Traffic Analysis

Actually, when we talk about getting Stars, we mean **promoting your project**. It's just that getting Stars is one resulting product. That is, during the project promotion process, we gain attention. As for promotion itself, different people have different views.

In fact, getting Stars on GitHub is similar to the marketing we usually know. First, attract users to our GitHub page, then give them motivation to follow (this is too hard).

So before starting, we can look at a chart to understand how to get traffic. The following is the traffic source statistics for "GitHub Roaming Guide" in the last two weeks (GitHub uses Google Analytics):

![GitHub Roaming Guide](../img/github_traffic.png)

From the chart, traffic mainly comes from several parts:

 - Direct access to the GitHub project
 - Direct access to GitHub
 - From social sites like Zhihu
 - Access from GitHub Pages
 - Access from other social sites

Overall, in this week, there were 1,266 visits, with 735 unique visitors. The data looks good, but the Star conversion rate is a bit low. According to the Star History website (https://star-history.t9t.io), in the past two months, it only gained 38 Stars.

![GitHub Roaming Guide Star History](../img/github-star-history.png)

From my analysis, there are roughly two reasons:

 1. Users are viewing the content on GitHub Pages
 2. Quantitatively, the audience isn't large

The conversion rate for the New Project Checklist ([https://github.com/phodal/new-project-checklist](https://github.com/phodal/new-project-checklist)) I'm recently playing with seems okay:

![GitHub New Project Checklist](../img/github-new-project-checklist.png)

Among 999 unique visitors, it got 202 Stars, a conversion rate of about 20%—people are really interested in this project.

So, let's emphasize the core part again: **You share the code/content people want.** Otherwise, even if you bring a lot of traffic, it may not convert into the attention you desire.

## Guide and Tips to Get Stars on GitHub

For a creator, they naturally hope their project is used by others. Even a little criticism can help the project move forward in a better way. That's the significance of promoting my own project. When creating a project, we often only create it according to our own needs, not others'. So when new demands appear, they might slightly affect the project's evolution direction. These directions can be good or bad; sometimes they might be more helpful to oneself.

Alright, back to our main topic, how to get Stars?

### Tip One: Combine SEO Skills

When we promote a project, what we do is actually similar to Search Engine Optimization (SEO). The slight difference is, during practice, GitHub helps optimize many details for us, allowing us to focus more on core elements.

Actually, in the previous section, we've introduced relevant content. If you want to get visits from search engines like Google, then the skills to master are:

![Google New Project Checklist](../img/google-new-project-checklist.png)

 - Simple and practical project name. The project name is placed at the forefront in Google search results, together with the URL.
 - Write a good project `Description`. No matter what, you must write a good Description for your project so people know what it does.
 - Set appropriate `topics`. GitHub designed a Topics page for projects. These pages are included in relevant indexes and can be searched from Google and other search engines and GitHub.
 - Include as external links in articles. As part of SEO, you need to appropriately reference your GitHub project in your blog and articles; it will bring traffic to your project.
 - Appropriate external link title. When a link exists, pay attention to the link title (consistent with the project theme); it affects search results to some extent.

These are just basics, not really tips, but doing fundamentals well is important.

### Tip Two: Complete, Readable README

Let's emphasize again, a good README is really important, important, important! Important.

GitHub is a person's resume, **and an open-source project's README is like a project's resume**. In this resume, you need to describe your project well:

 - **What does this project do?**?
 - **What problem does it solve?**
 - **What features does it have—hello, world example?**
 - **How to use this project?**
 - **What license does this project use?** Is commercial use allowed?

From my nearly 10 years of experience on GitHub, foreigners **love to boast about what features this project has**. At the same time, they will also "draw a big pie" (Roadmap) for this project, i.e., **what features this project will have in the future**—to achieve these, we need your care, support, and affection. So, if you're doing a groundbreaking project, say you want to implement an automated installation script, you can write under future features:

 - AI automated installation (TODO)

This is indeed a TODO—not bragging, but attracting onlookers.

### Tip Three: Social Sharing

As a senior technical consultant active in various communities, sharing related projects is a regular operation for me. Especially when seeing some "boring chats", I recommend my new project. Of course, generally, a project only gets promoted once or twice; frequent sharing is equivalent to **, you know.

**Update status**. When I'm writing an open-source project that interests many, I regularly update related statuses on my social accounts, like Weibo, Zhihu thoughts. For example:

![Weibo MoPass](../img/mopass-weibo.png)

In case someone is interested, they might come—mainly I don't know how to play Weibo either.

**Recommend your own project**. As an open-source author with many projects on GitHub and many articles, whenever I see related questions in WeChat groups, I directly share my open-source project. It's both showing off and reliable.

As for the frequency of sharing in WeChat groups, be moderate~, appropriate~.

### Tip Four: Articles

Since I've written such a great open-source project, the best way is to write an article introducing it. Blabla, finish writing a project usage documentation:

 - **Why is this project needed?**
 - **What is this project?**
 - **What problem does this project solve?**
 - **How to use this project?**

Is it easy to write?

In future articles, when there are related topics, you can slightly mention the related project. For example, in this article, I've introduced several recent projects. These articles are not only posted on my WeChat public account but also on my blog (accumulated 1 million visits), my Zhihu column, and my... Combined, they form a powerful force, attracting users and improving SEO.

### Tip Five: Seize GitHub Trending

In case, I mean in case, your project appears on GitHub Trending. Take a screenshot, then you can write another article ("How My Project Got on GitHub Trending", after all, getting on Trending is simple), post a Weibo, share a thought, record a short video, everyone come see this is my project.

Theoretically, being on GitHub Trending will attract more users—many websites, automated Weibo accounts, etc., introduce new Trending projects daily. Without accidents, it will bring you more traffic—meaning more attention.

### Not a Tip Tip: Persistence

In fact, as you know, the reason I get many Stars on GitHub is not because I have an excellent project. It's because I'm continuously updating, constantly working on projects I like on GitHub, investing time in sharing related skills, and have a series of related open-source projects.

We are continuously improving, building a free internet world, creating tools we love.

We are geeks, we love programming, we love sharing.
