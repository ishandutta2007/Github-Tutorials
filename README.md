# GitHub Tutorials

> Wandering means to travel freely.


In 2014, I wrote the ebook "[Building an IoT System Step by Step](https://github.com/phodal/designiot)".

On March 9, 2015, I decided to write a "[GitHub Navigation Guide](http://github.phodal.com/)", so at the very beginning, I wrote:

> My GitHub homepage shows the date I joined—``Joined on Nov 8, 2010``, when I was a freshman in college. In the years that followed, perhaps because I wasn't studying computer science, I didn't become proficient in using it. Today—``March 9, 2015``—I've discovered that GitHub is a social networking site for programmers.

But a long time has passed without any activity. Today is October 24, 2015, and I think it's time to achieve this goal.
